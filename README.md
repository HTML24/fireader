FI Reader
========

A little script (with danish text) for reading FI/PBS/Giro-files. It's intended for accountants.
Feel free to use it for whatever.


HOW TO:

Copy all files to a webserver folder.
Open index.php in a webbrowser.
Upload a PBS-file.
The index.php-file will post the PBS-file to new.php, which will read it and output information.

The ficard.php file is not really important for anything. I kept it here because I used it for simply reading all fi-cards in a particular folder insted of having it run as an online service with an upload form.
